            The Double Life of Miley Stewart: Balancing Fame and Friendship

          <p>
            Miley Stewart, the protagonist of the series, is a seemingly
            ordinary girl who transforms herself in colorful clothing and blonde
            hair, performing as the famous Hannah Montana in secret. Miley
            attempts to manage her school life, friendships, and music career
            without disclosing her secret identity with the support of her
            father and manager, Robby Ray Stewart, as well as her best friends,
            Lilly Truscott and Oliver Oken. But as the series goes on, the
            challenge of hiding her double life becomes increasingly difficult.

        The iconic blonde wig that was worn by Hannah Montana wore almost wasn't
        apart of the show! At first, Disney had considered giving Miley Stewart
        a different disguise, like a hat or sunglasses, but they eventually
        decided on the wig to make her transformation even more dramatic to the
        audience.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray">
        Miley Cyrus later revealed that she initially thought the wig
        was “hideous” but understood its importance in creating Hannah’s
        signature look!
